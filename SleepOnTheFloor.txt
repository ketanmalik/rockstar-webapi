Pack yourself a toothbrush dear<br />
Pack yourself a favorite blouse<br />
Take a withdrawal slip<br />
Take all of your savings out<br />
'Cause if we don't leave this town<br />
We might never make it out<br />
I was not born to drown<br />
Baby come on<br />

<br />

Forget what Father Brennan said<br />
We were not born in sin<br />
Leave a note on your bed<br />
Let your mother know you're safe<br />
And by the time she wakes<br />
We'll have driven through the state<br />
We'll have driven through the night<br />
Baby come on<br />

<br />

If the sun don't shine on me today<br />
And if the subways flood and bridges break<br />
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave<br />
Or will you rail against your dying day<br />

<br />

And when we looked outside<br />
Couldn't even see the sky<br />
How do you pay the rent<br />
Is it your parents<br />
Or is hard work dear<br />
Holding the atmosphere<br />
I don't wanna live like that, yeah<br />
If the sun don't shine on me today<br />
If the subways flood and bridges break<br />
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight<br />
Put on your dress, yes wear something nice<br />
Decide on me, yea decide on us<br />
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois<br />

<br />

Pack yourself a toothbrush dear<br />
Pack yourself a favorite blouse<br />
Take a withdrawal slip<br />
Take all of your savings out<br />
'Cause if we don't leave this town<br />
We might never make it out<br />
